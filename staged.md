title: "Production snapshot: SNAPSHOT"
---

The following packages are staged for the SNAPSHOT [Production](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html) snapshot because they passed [R-multiverse checks](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html#checks) at least once during the month-long period leading up to the snapshot date.

This package list empties out during every [dependency freeze](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html#month-1-dependency-freeze), repopulates every [candidate freeze](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html#month-2-candidate-freeze), and stays constant during the [month after the Production snapshot](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html#month-3-production-snapshot).
See the [Production schedule](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html#schedule) for specific dates.
See the [Production documentation](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html) for details.
