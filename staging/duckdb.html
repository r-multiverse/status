    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package duckdb version 1.1.3-1 remote hash c043baa69d202263750bd19a14eb04f6e735c5b6 (as of 2025-02-28).<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 1.1.3-2 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse Staging period. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
