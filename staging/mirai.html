    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package mirai version 2.0.0 remote hash 645738f41fbfac835bbce76596d6f924ce3c9549 (as of 2025-02-28).<br><br>One or more strong R package dependencies have issues: nanonext. Dependency nanonext is explicitly mentioned in 'Depends:', 'Imports:', or 'LinkingTo:' in the DESCRIPTION file of mirai.<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 2.1.0 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse Staging period. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
