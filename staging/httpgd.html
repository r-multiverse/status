    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package httpgd version 2.0.3 remote hash 7181a6fb9c863b710ebcf718f0585070aab5c194 (last published at 2025-05-14 01:00:22.170 UTC).<br><br>Package httpgd declares license 'GPL (>= 2)' in its DESCRIPTION file. R-multiverse cannot verify that this license is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">valid free and open-source license</a>. Each package contributed to R-multiverse must have a valid open-source license to protect the intellectual property rights of the package owners.<br><br>One or more strong R package dependencies have issues: unigd. Dependency unigd is explicitly mentioned in 'Depends:', 'Imports:', or 'LinkingTo:' in the DESCRIPTION file of httpgd.<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 2.0.4 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse dependency freeze. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
