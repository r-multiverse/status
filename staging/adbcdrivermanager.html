    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package adbcdrivermanager version 0.15.0 remote hash 4bd94e2f9b56ebed3aa2639ff515e758930c8c9b (as of 2025-02-28).<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 0.16.0 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse Staging period. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
