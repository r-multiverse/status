    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package nanonext version 1.4.0 remote hash a7394f4505097a4e1a2078ac6bc05fa23b1ea7bf (as of 2025-02-28).<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 1.5.0 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse Staging period. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
