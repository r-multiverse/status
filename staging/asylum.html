    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package asylum version 1.1.1 remote hash 22064dd0822e007ef78cd29e9a118beb09e76da4 (last published at 2025-05-14 01:15:31.686 UTC).<br><br>Package asylum declares license 'MIT + file LICENSE' in its DESCRIPTION file. R-multiverse cannot verify that this license is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">valid free and open-source license</a>. Each package contributed to R-multiverse must have a valid open-source license to protect the intellectual property rights of the package owners.<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 1.1.2 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse dependency freeze. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
