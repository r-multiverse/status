</pre>One or more strong R package dependencies have issues: rlang. Dependency rlang is explicitly mentioned in 'Depends:', 'Imports:', or 'LinkingTo:' in the DESCRIPTION file of IMD.<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 1.2.2 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse dependency freeze. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
