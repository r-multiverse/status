    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package IMD version 1.2.1 remote hash 8cc26c4f70bf6e07c47bab089c7bad18c864223c (last published at 2025-05-08 06:29:58.701 UTC).<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 1.2.2 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse dependency freeze. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
