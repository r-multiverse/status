    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package crew version 0.10.2 remote hash 859a9b465e25e0ced329c36206488fb61382880c (as of 2025-02-28).<br><br>One or more strong R package dependencies have issues: mirai, nanonext, rlang. Dependency mirai is explicitly mentioned in 'Depends:', 'Imports:', or 'LinkingTo:' in the DESCRIPTION file of crew. Dependencies nanonext, rlang are not part of 'Depends:', 'Imports:', or 'LinkingTo:' in the DESCRIPTION file of crew, but they are upstream of one or more strong direct dependencies:<br><pre>nanonext: mirai
rlang: later
</pre>On CRAN, this package had version 1.0.0 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse Staging period. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
