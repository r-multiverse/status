The following packages are staged for the SNAPSHOT [Production](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html) snapshot because they passed [R-multiverse checks](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html#checks) at least once during the month-long period leading up to the snapshot date.
See the [Production documentation](https://r-multiverse.org/production.html) for details.
