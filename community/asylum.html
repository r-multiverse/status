</pre>On CRAN, this package had version 1.1.2 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse Staging period. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
