    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package httpgd version 2.0.3 remote hash 7181a6fb9c863b710ebcf718f0585070aab5c194 (last published at 2025-06-05 03:56:53.332 UTC).<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 2.0.4 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse dependency freeze. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
