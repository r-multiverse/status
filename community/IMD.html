    <p>R-multiverse found issues with package IMD version 1.2.1 remote hash 8cc26c4f70bf6e07c47bab089c7bad18c864223c (last published at 2025-05-14 01:10:32.895 UTC).<br><br>Package IMD declares license 'MIT + file LICENSE' in its DESCRIPTION file. R-multiverse cannot verify that this license is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">valid free and open-source license</a>. Each package contributed to R-multiverse must have a valid open-source license to protect the intellectual property rights of the package owners.<br><br>One or more strong R package dependencies have issues: rlang. Dependency rlang is explicitly mentioned in 'Depends:', 'Imports:', or 'LinkingTo:' in the DESCRIPTION file of IMD.<br><br>On CRAN, this package had version 1.2.2 during the first day of the most recent R-multiverse dependency freeze. The version on R-multiverse is lower, which causes install.packages() to prefer CRAN. If you have not already done so, please ensure the latest GitHub/GitLab release has a suitably recent version in the DESCRIPTION file.<br><br></p>
